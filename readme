q1: Two Sum
Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to
the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers
(both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

q2: Add Two Numbers 
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

q3: Longest substring without repeating
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Examples:
Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.
k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.
You may not alter the values in the nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
Only constant memory is allowed.
For example,

For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5

q26: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Example:
Given input array nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.

3,2,1 → 1,2,3
1,1,5 → 1,5,1

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

q34: Search for a Range
Given an array of integers sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.

isMatch("aa", "a*") → true
isMatch("ab", "?*") → true
isMatch("aab", "c*a*b") → false

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

Example 1:
Given intervals [1,3],[6,9], insert and merge [2,5] in as [1,5],[6,9].

Example 2:
Given [1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16], insert and merge [4,9] in as [1,2],[3,10],[12,16].

This is because the new interval [4,9] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
